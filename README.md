# customer-journey-analalysis1# Customer-Journey-Analysis-Using-Clustering-and-Dimensionality-Reduction-Enhancing-User-Experience-
This project analyzes customer behavior patterns using K-Means Clustering and UMAP Dimensionality Reduction to segment users based on their interaction with travel-related platforms. It helps identify high-value customers, casual browsers, and frequent travelers for personalized marketing strategies.
ðŸ“Š Customer Journey Analysis Using Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction

ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

The Customer Journey Analysis (CJA) project aims to analyze user behavior patterns on travel-related platforms. By leveraging K-Means Clustering and UMAP Dimensionality Reduction, this project segments customers based on their browsing habits, check-ins, and time spent on travel pages.

This segmentation helps businesses identify high-value customers, casual browsers, and frequent travelers, enabling personalized marketing and user experience improvements.

ðŸš€ Key Features
	1.	Data Upload: Upload customer behavior datasets via an interactive Streamlit interface.
	2.	Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for clustering, like yearly views, check-ins, and comments.
	3.	Dimensionality Reduction: Use UMAP to simplify complex datasets while retaining meaningful patterns.
	4.	Customer Clustering: Apply K-Means clustering to segment users into behavioral groups.
	5.	Visualization: Display clusters with scatter plots, bar charts, and funnel visualizations.
	6.	Downloadable Results: Export the segmented dataset as a CSV or Pickle file for further analysis.
